# Forgot Password Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
Fixed 500 Internal Server Error in the forgot password API endpoint that was preventing the password reset functionality from working in production.

## Root Cause
The original EmailJS integration was designed for client-side use only, but the forgot password API endpoint runs on the server side. EmailJS's browser SDK cannot run in a Node.js server environment.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Server-Side EmailJS Integration
- Implemented direct EmailJS REST API calls for server-side email sending
- Added proper error handling and logging for debugging
- Maintained backward compatibility for client-side usage

### 2. Key Changes Made

#### `/src/app/api/auth/forgot-password/route.ts`
- Added `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` export to prevent static generation errors
- Implemented direct EmailJS REST API integration inline to avoid module issues
- Enhanced logging for production debugging
- Added comprehensive error handling

#### Environment Variables Required
The following environment variables must be set in Vercel:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID` - Your EmailJS Service ID
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY` - Your EmailJS Public Key  
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_PASSWORD_RESET` - Template ID for password reset emails
- `EMAILJS_PRIVATE_KEY` - EmailJS Private Key (optional, for enhanced security)

### 3. Email Flow
1. User enters email on forgot password page
2. API validates user exists and is active
3. Generates secure temporary password (10 characters with mixed case, numbers, symbols)
4. Updates password in database with bcrypt hash
5. Sends email via EmailJS REST API with temporary password
6. Returns success message (same response regardless of user existence for security)

### 4. Security Features
- Password enumeration protection (same response for existing/non-existing emails)
- Secure temporary password generation
- bcrypt password hashing (12 rounds)
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging
- Input validation and sanitization

### 5. Testing Steps
1. Deploy to Vercel with proper environment variables
2. Test forgot password functionality
3. Check Vercel function logs for any configuration issues
4. Verify emails are delivered (check spam folders)

### 6. Production Readiness
- ✅ Build compiles successfully
- ✅ All TypeScript errors resolved
- ✅ Server-side email functionality implemented
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and logging
- ✅ Security best practices implemented
- ✅ Environment variable documentation provided

## Next Steps
1. Set up EmailJS environment variables in Vercel
2. Test the forgot password functionality in production
3. Monitor Vercel function logs for any configuration issues
4. Ensure EmailJS templates are properly configured
