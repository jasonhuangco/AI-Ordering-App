# 🎯 ADMIN USERS - TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

## ✅ **Progress Update:**

1. **Cleared Next.js cache** ✅
2. **Restarted development server** ✅  
3. **Server running on port 3001** ✅
4. **Rebuilt admin users API route** ✅

## 🚀 **Test Instructions:**

### Step 1: Access New Port
Your app is now running on **http://localhost:3001** (port 3000 was in use)

### Step 2: Test Admin Users
1. Go to `http://localhost:3001/admin/settings`
2. Click on the **"Users"** tab
3. Watch the browser console for these logs:
   ```
   👥 Admin users GET request received
   🔍 Fetching admin users from database
   ✅ Found X admin users
   ```

### Step 3: Check Terminal Logs
Watch your terminal for the same logs to confirm the API is being called.

### Step 4: If Users Don't Show
If you see "No admin users found" but the admin exists in Supabase:

**Option A: Check Database**
```sql
SELECT id, email, role, is_active FROM users WHERE role = 'ADMIN';
```

**Option B: Test API Directly**
Go to: `http://localhost:3001/api/admin/users` in browser
Should show JSON with admin users.

## 🐛 **Expected Outcomes:**

✅ **Success**: Admin users appear in the users tab  
✅ **API Working**: Console shows detailed logs  
❌ **Still Issues**: We'll debug specific error messages  

## 📞 **Next Steps:**

Try accessing the users tab on port 3001 and let me know:
1. What you see in the browser console
2. What appears in the terminal logs  
3. Whether admin users show up in the list

The cache clearing should have fixed the compilation error! 🎉
