## üîß Technical Implementation

### Database Schema:
```sql
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN is_archived BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false;
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_is_archived ON orders(is_archived);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_status_archived ON orders(status, is_archived);
```

### API Response Changes:
Orders now include an `isArchived` field:
```typescript
interface Order {
  id: string
  // ... other fields
  isArchived?: boolean
  // ... other fields
}
```
