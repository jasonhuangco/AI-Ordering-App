# Enhanced Production Schedule with Coffee-Specific Details

## Summary of Changes

You now have a comprehensive production system that includes coffee-specific details like bean origin, roast level, and automatic pound calculations for production planning.

## SQL Database Update

**File**: `add-production-fields-supabase.sql`

Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor to add the following fields to your products table:

- `bean_origin` - Origin of coffee beans (Brazilian, Ethiopian, Colombian, etc.)
- `roast_level` - Roast specification (Light, Medium, Dark, French)
- `production_weight_per_unit` - Weight in pounds needed per unit sold
- `production_unit` - Production unit (defaults to 'lbs')
- `production_notes` - Special production instructions
- `processing_method` - Bean processing (Washed, Natural, Honey)
- `flavor_profile` - Array of flavor notes

The SQL also includes sample data updates:
- Decaf products ‚Üí Brazilian beans, Medium roast
- Espresso/Signature ‚Üí Ethiopian beans, Medium-Dark roast  
- Other whole beans ‚Üí Colombian beans, Medium roast

## Enhanced Production Schedule Features

### üè≠ **Production-Focused Display**
- **Bean Origins**: See which origins you need to roast (Brazilian Decaf, Ethiopian Espresso)
- **Roast Levels**: Organize production by roast specifications
- **Pound Calculations**: Automatic conversion to production weight in pounds
- **Processing Notes**: Special instructions like "Swiss Water Process decaffeination"

### üìä **Production Metrics**
- **Total Weight**: Shows total pounds to produce (not just unit count)
- **Per-Order Weight**: Each order shows both unit quantity AND production weight
- **Origin Grouping**: Products grouped by bean origin and roast level
- **Flavor Profiles**: See flavor notes for quality control

### üîß **Enhanced Product Management**
- **Production Fields**: Edit form now includes all production details
- **Weight Per Unit**: Specify how many pounds each unit requires
- **Origin Tracking**: Track which beans are used for each product
- **Processing Methods**: Document how beans should be processed

## Example Production Output

Instead of just seeing:
```
Signature Espresso: 50 units needed
```

You now see:
```
Signature Espresso
Origin: Ethiopian | Roast: Medium-Dark | Process: Natural
50 units = 50.0 lbs to produce
Flavor Profile: Bright, Fruity, Wine-like
Orders: ORD-1001 (10 units/10.0 lbs), ORD-1002 (40 units/40.0 lbs)
```

## Production Planning Benefits

### **For Daily Roasting**
- Know exactly which origins to prep
- Group by roast level for batch efficiency  
- See total pounds needed per product
- Track special processing requirements

### **For Inventory Management**
- Plan green bean purchasing by origin
- Understand roast level distribution
- Calculate total roasting capacity needed
- Track production weight vs. sales units

### **For Quality Control**
- Maintain flavor profile consistency
- Follow specific processing methods
- Track production notes and special requirements
- Ensure proper roast specifications

## Files Modified/Created

### **Database**
- `add-production-fields-supabase.sql` - SQL to add production fields

### **API Enhancement**  
- `/api/admin/production` - Updated to include production calculations

### **UI Updates**
- `/admin/production` - Enhanced display with production details
- `/admin/products/[id]/edit` - Added production fields to product editing

### **Documentation**
- `docs/PRODUCTION_SCHEDULE.md` - Updated with production features

## Next Steps

1. **Run the SQL**: Execute `add-production-fields-supabase.sql` in Supabase
2. **Update Products**: Edit existing products to add bean origins and roast levels
3. **Test Production View**: Check the enhanced production schedule
4. **Plan Production**: Use the new pound calculations for real production planning

The system now transforms from a basic order list into a professional coffee production planning tool that understands your specific roasting requirements! ‚òïüìã
